					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Orr Inbar, and I am an MLA candidate at the Extension School concentrating
					in software engineering. I am 29 and I work as a private consultant and data scientist. When
					I am not trolling stackoverflow I enjoy competitive procrastination and TV binging ;-)</p>
					
					<h2>Why I'm taking this course</h2>
					<p>My primary interests lie in building interactive analytical models. Since Web is now the
					best platform(imo) for application development, I have come to learn it.

					<h2>My Experience with HTML/CSS</h2>
					<p>Well, its not much. I have written some primitive web content on google app engine,
					and I've been working on a<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253"> course </a>on basic web 
					development on udacity. I plan to spend countless hours banging my head against the chrome HTML
					inspector, and thanking the internet gods for bringing us modern tools such as bootstrap, jquery, and 
					MVCs (cause apparently web development really used to suck before all that)<p>

					<h2>My Experience with PHP</h2>
					<p>None. I have some experience with Java, python, SQL, OCAML, and VB. I expect that most of my knowledge
					should carry over</p>				
					
					<h2>My Programming Experience</h2>
					<p>I have been coding for about four years on and off.  I have probably written on the order of 10-20k (not much)
					lines of spaghetti code, in higher level languages.  Probably about half of that was
					for comp-sci classes, and the other half for doing data analysis and scripting on the job. 	
					
					<h2>My Platform</h2>
					<p>Machine: Macbook air mid 2011<br>
					OS: Mac OSX Maverics<br>
					Text editor: Sublime/TextWrangler<br>
					Browser: Chrome</p>
